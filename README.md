## Welcome to my webpage

An Aerospace graduate student from Purdue University working in the field of Composites at the prestigious Indiana Manufacturing Institute under the guidance of Dr.Dianyun Zhang.

I am interested in a plethora of things out of which one is research in the field of composites, I love films and the art of filmmaking and plan to pursue it sometime down the line.

I am currently enrolled in the Direct PhD program at Purdue University and am awarded Ross Fellowship to support my graduate studies.
